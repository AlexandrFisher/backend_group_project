        <br>
        <p>
            YOU ARE FAMILY. Our brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters in arms. We understand better than
            most what it means to serve for country, faith, loves ones, and for a better tomorrow because we served for
            those reasons too. We know the highs and lows that come with military service. The disconnect
            and difficulty that occurs when the world around you, your inner thoughts and personal struggles lead to
            doubt and despair. WE ARE HERE to help you through these times of challenge. We are the keepers of our family
            and YOU ARE FAMILY.</p> <br> <br> <p>If you are dealing with difficult times and need to chat anonymously or are willing to lend
            your time to those in their moment of need, YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. Welcome to Block-22 where we work
            to change the meaning and the very idea of '22'.

        Life in the Army... Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. &nbsp <i>Alex -</i>

        As a concerned citizen... Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, 
        but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, 
        or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,
        you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. &nbsp <i>Alina -</i>

        As a former Marine Staff Sergeant I've served in the U.S. and overseas, in peace time and war and no matter the 
        theater of operations, there are moments that stick with you, even the ones that you wish did not. And that's why 
        I'm here, to help you remember and enjoy the good times, yet help you cope with the bad times as well. Let 
        Block-22 be a tool within your toolbox. Your quick release when that backpack of life gets a little to heavy.
        Remember, we're never to far gone that we can't, with a little assistance, get back up. Semper Gumby & Semper Fi.
